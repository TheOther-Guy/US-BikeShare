# US-BikeShare

This is quite a small project but I do like it I have created 8 functions "main" included to analyze Us Bikeshare data and here is the link to kaggle page: https://www.kaggle.com/samratp/bikeshare-analysis/notebooks

i have used spyder and python 3.8 the code file contains 225 lines of code and it goes as follows:

First, the program will ask the User to choose a city and in this case "Chicago, new york or Washington"

Second, it will ask the user to choose a month between January till June or all to analyze the whole dataset.

Third, it will ask to type the day of the week or all to analyze the whole week.

Those are the first 3 steps where the user have to choose the data he wants to analyze and I have worked on this part a bit to avoid typos and capitalizing so the steps before the analysis will be like this,



And it will show to the user the filters he chooses before doing the analysis as a confirmation.
At this point, the function starts to work and will give to the user some insights about the data based on the filters he chose like:
the most frequent time to travel.
the most frequent stations and trips.
Trip Durations "Travel time, mean travel time
Also it calculates the time took the machine to produce the info at each step.
