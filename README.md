# US-BikeShare

creating data filters on the city, month, and day of the week based on user choice then show data like... 
"Calculating The Most Popular Stations and Trip, Calculating Trip Duration, and calculating User Stats" 
then ask to display row data if no then ask if want to restart if no terminate.
I used while loops for filters and created some functions to deal with the data picking and displaying.
